This course will introduce you the basics of programming and automatization of GIS-processes in the Python programming language.

Materials have been tailored for the further education course *Paikkatiedon käyttö ja hyödyntäminen* F.E.C. organized by `HY+ <http://hyplus.helsinki.fi/>`_.

The course consists of interactive lectures and exercises. All course material will be distributed via these pages. Materials are based on previous further education courses and two more extensive course packages: `Python for geo-people <https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Course-information>`_ and `Automating GIS-processes <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/>`_ developed at the `Department of Geosciences and Geography <http://www.helsinki.fi/geo/english/index.html>`_, University of Helsinki.

At the end of the course you should be able to generate, understand and use code for automating GIS-processes such as the one below.
