Create a GitHub-account
=======================

During this course, we will use GitHub as the place for **distributing scripts
and documenting our work**. For example, the source code of these pages can be found
and downloaded from `here <https://github.com/Automating-GIS-processes/FEC>`_

Both **Git** and **GitHub** provide many more features than the ones mentioned
here, and we encourage you to start using them for version control, documenting your personal work and collaborating with others.
