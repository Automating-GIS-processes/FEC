Task: Hello world!
==================

.. admonition:: Task

    Open Spyder and write a small script which prints out "Hello World!". You can copy
    and paste the code below:

    .. code:: python

        print("Hello World!")

    Next, try to make your code a bit more flexible by using variables:

    .. code:: python

        #Define text variables:
        a = "Hello again"
        b = "World!"

        #Print out "Hello again World!" using variables a and b
        print() # update this line of code!
