Exercise 1: Lists
==================

In the first exercise we will learn how to work with GitHub when creating and updating script files.
The main purpose of the exercise is to get familiar with the pyhton syntax, most common data types and the basic workflow in GitHub.
We will also familiarize ourselves with the MarkDown-syntax (*.md-files) that we will use for documenting our work on GitHub.

The Exercise is divided into three problems:

- In **Problem 1** you will have to upload a new script-file into the Exercise 1 repository.
- In **Problem 2** you will need to fix a broken code so that it works as expected (practicing lists and indices).
- In **Problem 3** you will practice the mardown-syntax by modifying the README-file of your exercise submission.
