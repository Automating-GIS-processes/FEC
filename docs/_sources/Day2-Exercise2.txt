Exercise 2: For-loops and conditional statements
================================================

Next, let's practice how to use for-loops and conditional statements in slightly more demanding (but useful!) tasks.
The exercise consists of three problems. After you have solved the given problems, remember to upload your scripts to GitHub!

Note that **Problem 3** (the flag-exercise) is an extra task, don't worry if you can't get it done straight away.
