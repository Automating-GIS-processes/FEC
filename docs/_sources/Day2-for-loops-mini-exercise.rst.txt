Mini-exercise on for-loops
==========================

.. admonition:: Task

    1. Write a short script which prints out numbers 1-10 using a for-loop (2 lines of code!).
    Comment your code and store it in a script file `printNumbers.py`

    2. Make a script which prints numbers 10-20. You can use the script `printNumbers.py` as a starting point (make a copy and store it as `printNumbers_if.py`)

    You might need to use an if-statement in order to complete the second task. Can you think of a way to print numbers 10-20 without the if-statement?
