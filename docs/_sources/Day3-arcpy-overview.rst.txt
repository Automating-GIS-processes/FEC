This week we will take a quick tour on **how to use Python in ArcGIS** using `arcpy <http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/analyze/arcpy/what-is-arcpy-.htm>`_ -module.
Exceptionally we won't be using the computer instance for going through the lesson materials (it is a bit tricky to install on Linux, however, it **can** be done),
instead we will be using the GIS-lab computers where `ArcGIS <http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/>`_ is installed. ArcGIS is not an open source or freely available
software such as `Quantum GIS <http://www.qgis.org/en/site/>`_ or the Python tools that we have been using. However, it is widely used software in many places (companies, public sector etc.)
which is the reason why we give this short introduction how you can automatize the ArcGIS workflows using Python scripting with arcpy -module.

Learning objectives
-------------------

The aim for the rest of the week is to learn the basics how the ArcGIS tools can be run using arcpy functions, and how we can
create a graphical user interface for your custom scripts using ArcGIS Toolbox (.tbx -file). In practice, we will incrementally create an ArcGIS Python tool that
**converts the individual Damselfish species distribution Polygons into raster layers** (``.tif``) as an example of such tool.

After completing the arcpy-lesson and exercises you should be able to:

 - Create a simple user interface using ArcGIS ToolBox.

 - Run ArcGIS-tools tools from Python using the ArcPy-module.

 - Find and know how to read the ArcPy documentation online.
