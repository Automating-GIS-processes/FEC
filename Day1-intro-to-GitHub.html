<p>One of the core components of this course (besides learning programming)
is to learn how to use <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version
control</a> with
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> and storing your

<p><strong>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to learn how to avoid this situation!?!?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve all been in this situation before: it seems ridiculous to have
multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word
processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft
Word’s “Track Changes”.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>What is version control and why to use it?</div></blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">Version control</a> is
used to track and store changes in your files without losing the history
of your past changes.</p>
<p>Version control systems start with a base version of the document and
then save just the changes you made at each step of the way. You can
think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base
document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest
version.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id2">
<img alt="Illustration of committing changes" src="../img/play-changes.PNG" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Illustration of committing changes</span></p>
</div>
<p>A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for
us and helps us version our files <em>(`and
merge &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)&gt;`__</em>- not
covered in this course). It allows you to decide which changes make up
the next version, called a commit, and keeps useful metadata about them.
The complete history of commits for a particular project and their
metadata make up a repository (such as our course material
repositories). Repositories can be kept in sync across different
computers facilitating also collaboration among different people.</p>
<p>There are multiple different Version Control Systems (VCS) (i.e. a
software for doing version control) but one of the most popular one is
<strong>`Git &lt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)&gt;`__</strong> that was
created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is the version control system
that is running behind the scenes and used with GitHub. And that&#8217;s
actually where its name &#8216;Git - Hub&#8217; originates from.</p>
<p><strong>Why to use it?</strong></p>
<p>One of the most obvious reasons why to use version control is to avoid
the situation illustrated in the <a class="reference external" href="#motivation">comics above</a>, i.e. to
keep track of the full history of your changes in a systematic way
without the need to have multiple versions of the same file. One really
useful feature of version control is the ability to &#8220;go back in time&#8221;,
i.e. if something goes wrong, you can start from some earlier version of
the file when everything was still working. You can also compare the
differences between versions and see what has changed. In addition
aforementioned aspects, version control makes possible for multiple
people to work on the same file or project at the same time while still
keeping track of their own changes to the files.</p>
<p><strong>Some basic vocabulary of Version Control</strong></p>
<p>Few basic terms that are used often when discussing about version
control (not exhaustive).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Repository</strong> = a location where all the files for a particular
project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will
have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be
accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example).</li>
<li><strong>Commit</strong> = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the
working copy back to the repository. Whe you commit, you are
basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in
time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore
your project to any previous state. The terms &#8216;commit&#8217; or &#8216;checkin&#8217;
can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is
created as a result of committing.</li>
<li><strong>Revision / version</strong> = A revision or a version is any change in
made in any form to a document(s).</li>
<li><strong>Clone</strong> = Cloning means creating a repository containing the
revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or
pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two
repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized,
and contain the same revisions.</li>
<li><strong>Pull / push</strong> = Copy revisions from one repository into another.
Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is
initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for
pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update.</li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong> = A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets
of changes are applied to a file or set of files.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div>What is GitHub?</div></blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Now that you know the basics of version control we can dive into
explaining what GitHub is.</p>
<p><strong>Relies on Git</strong></p>
<p>GitHub in principle is a web based Git repository hosting service. Thus
it wouldn&#8217;t exist without the version control system Git. Git is also
running all the time in the background when using GitHub.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a> is a version
control software (developped by a rather famous Finn named Linus
Torvalds - he also created Linux!) that is used to track and store
changes in your files (often source code for programs) without losing
the history of past changes. Files in Git are stored in a repository,
which you can simply think of as a directory containing files (or other
directories) related to a single &#8216;project&#8217;. Git is widely used by
professionals to keep track of what they’ve done and to collaborate with
other people.</p>
<p><strong>Social (collaborative) network</strong></p>
<p>However, GitHub is much more than just a hosting service for Git
repositories as it is also a social network where people can collaborate
with each other. It is also easy to invite other GitHub users to work
with the same project. GitHub is a highly popular place for sharing
codes openly to the entire world or alternatively only to the
collaborators working on the same project.</p>
<p><strong>Open source / science</strong></p>
<p>All publicly available repositories can also be downloaded to your own
local computer where you can start modifying the codes for your own
purpose which is called &#8220;forking&#8221;. However, you should always check and
follow the license terms mentioned in the project that basically tells
you what you can do (and what not) with the codes that are shared.
Usually there might be some limitations for commercial use of the codes
for example. Sharing your work publicly to others is also the basic
principle of open science.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>GitHub repositories are often also used as web pages for different
projects. In GitHub such web pages typically include technical
documentation, instructions and examples how to use the codes or
software shared on that page. <strong>It is extremely important that you
document well your codes and programs that you have done!</strong> GitHub
provides a nice platform for doing and sharing such documentation.</p>
<p>Each repository (and possibly its subfolders) includes a file called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> that by default is the front-page of the given repository
in GitHub. Those files are written using a specific simple language
called <a class="reference external" href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> that
can be used to create nice looking web pages with different formattings,
figures, tables and so on. Markdown is really easy to use once you have
learned the basic syntax of how different textual elements are written.</p>
<p><strong>Online tools</strong></p>
<p>There are multiple useful tools integrated into GitHub such as
possibility to edit the documents or codes directly from the web site.
What is even better is that Git is always running in background also in
the web environment, thus all your changes made in the web browser will
be saved as commits. It is also possible to browse the whole history of
a file directly from the GitHub&#8217;s online interface and track the changes
that you have done.</p>
<p>Usually Git (the software) is run from the command prompt but GitHub
provides a way to do Git commands without the need to run any commands
in the terminal. There are, however, also other graphical user
interfaces for Git that comes with some <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">Integrated Development
Environments
(IDE)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Issue tracking</strong></p>
<p>In GitHub it is also possible to give feedback to the developer by
creating a specific &#8220;Issue&#8221; that can be used to report for example a bug
that was found in the code or software. Issues can also be used to track
ideas, enhancements, tasks for projects on GitHub. You can use Issues
also to organize tasks you&#8217;d like to accomplish, such as adding new
features or auditing old ones.</p>
